# Amazon Rainforest Satellite Image Classification

This project is an implementation of a convolutional neural network that classifies satellite imagery of the Amazon rainforest into 17 categories, such as clear, cloudy, agriculture, road, water, etc. The dataset used is a collection of satellite images from the Amazon basin, labeled with various atmospheric conditions and land cover types. The goal of the dataset is to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest.

The project is based on the Kaggle competition [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space).
